# icecult-reborn
Forked from [eiskaltdcpp/icecult](https://github.com/eiskaltdcpp/icecult).
Alternative webinterface for [eiskaltdcpp-daemon](https://github.com/eiskaltdcpp/eiskaltdcpp).

# Features:
* Connect to hubs
* Chat (History stored in Browser)
* Browse filelists of hub's users
* Download folders/files
* List of current/queued downloads
* Show Hash status and Upload/Download-Ratio
* Search on current server (thanks, [campbebj](https://github.com/eiskaltdcpp/icecult/pull/26))

### ðŸ”½ Frontender HELP WANTED
Planned:
* Search sorting
* Optimize quering users on the current server
* Fix Bug, if the file name in the search is too long, the download button disappears beyond the visibility zone
* Search on all servers
* Optimize frontend (rewrite?)

# Screenshots
*needs to update
* Hubs: [*click*](https://raw.github.com/eiskaltdcpp/icecult/master/screens/icecult_hubs.png)
* Browse: [*click*](https://raw.github.com/eiskaltdcpp/icecult/master/screens/icecult_browse.png)
* Queue: [*click*](https://raw.github.com/eiskaltdcpp/icecult/master/screens/icecult_queue.png)

# Install
### Simple
Clone the repository to your local disk
```shell
git clone https://github.com/NikitaBeloglazov/icecult-reborn
```
Then install flask module
```shell
pip3 install flask
```
And then test it with the running daemon. If need, use Testing section below.
```shell
python3 redirect.py
```

### Setting up without package completely manually
```shell
git clone https://github.com:NikitaBeloglazov/icecult-reborn.git /tmp/icecult
cd /tmp/icecult
git checkout $VERSION
install -Dm 644  contrib/systemd/icecult.service /etc/systemd/system/icecult.service
install -Dm 644  contrib/systemd/icecult.env /etc/icecult.conf
install -Dm 644  contrib/systemd/icecult.sysusers /usr/lib/sysusers.d/system-user-icecult.conf
install -Dm 755  redirect.py /usr/bin/icecult
install -Dm 644 ./contrib/icecult_nginx_conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/icecult.conf
cp  app/* /var/lib/icecult/
systemd-sysusers /usr/lib/sysusers.d/system-user-valheim-server.conf
pip3 install flask
# edit env/cfg file as you need
systemctl enable --now icecult.service
cd ~
rm -rf /tmp/icecult
```

by default, the daemon runs as a separate user (`icecult`) who must also be present in the system.

If you need, [configure the daemon](/../../blob/main/SETTING_DAEMON.md) and configure server below

# Config

### Notation
*NAME_OF_VARIABLE = DEFAULT_VALUE

`DEMON_ADDRESS_AND_PORT = "127.0.0.0:3121"` â€” IP address and port where eiskaltdaemon jsonrpc interface is located

`WEB_ADDRESS = "0.0.0.0"` â€” IP address where the panel (icecult) will be located. Normally, editing this value is not necessary. If you don't know what it is, don't touch it.

`WEB_PORT = 8080` â€” Port where the panel (icecult) will be located. Useful with NAT servers
## Using env
Just write parameters before the main run command, like that:
```shell
DEMON_ADDRESS_AND_PORT="127.0.0.0:3121" WEB_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0" WEB_PORT="8080" python3 redirect.py
```
**If you don't know what env is and how to work with it** -> [*click*](https://web.archive.org/web/20221222050656/https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/administration-linux/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-linux/)

## Using systemd
**\*Relevant if you installed a ready-made package or installed completely manually, including unit for systemd**
* configure environments in env/cfg file `/etc/icecult.conf` with your parameters.
eg:
```ini
DEMON_ADDRESS_AND_PORT="127.0.0.1:3121"
WEB_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1"
WEB_PORT="8080"
```
* enable autostart & run service
```shell
systemctl enable --now icecult.service
```
* or restart service if it's already running
```shell
systemctl restart icecult.service
```

## Edit defauls in python file 
**\*Not recommended to use, your values may be erased during update**
* Open redirect.py file in text editor
* Search with keywords `# default`
* Replace default values to desired values

# Testing / Debug / Troubleshooting
* Try run `eiskaltdcpp-daemon --debug`
* If the connection with the demon is not happening, try running test_rpc.py, and look at the logs, if nothing happens at all, the redirect for some reason does not work at all
* You can also try specify `debug=True` in redirect.py (located at the end of the file)

# Contribution
* Patches are welcome!
* If you need to add extra library, then:
  * check the license of that library very carefully
  * check if that library is actively maintained (for fixing possible bugs in it)
  * try to find a usual CDN server hosting the file and only if you can't find one, copy source version of javascript file into this repo
* To speed up the process [write to maintainer](https://t.me/NikitaBeloglazov)
